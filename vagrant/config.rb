# uncomment the necessary lines, leaving the $, and replace everything
# after the equals sign..

# Size of the CoreOS cluster created by Vagrant
$num_instances=1

# Change basename of the VM
# The default value is "core", which results in VMs named starting with
# "core-01" through to "core-${num_instances}".

# Enable by setting value to true, disable with false

# VirtualBox, so should only be used in debugging situations
#$enable_serial_logging=false

# Enable port forwarding of Docker TCP socket
# Set to the TCP port you want exposed on the *host* machine, default is 2375
# If 2375 is used, Vagrant will auto-increment (e.g. in the case of $num_instances > 1)
# You can then use the docker tool locally by setting the following env var:
#   export DOCKER_HOST='tcp://127.0.0.1:2375'
$expose_docker_tcp=2375

# Enable NFS sharing of your home directory ($HOME) to CoreOS
# It will be mounted at the same path in the VM as on the host.

# or, to map host folders to guest folders of the same name,
# $shared_folders = Hash[*['/home/foo/app1', '/home/foo/app2'].map{|d| [d, d]}.flatten]
